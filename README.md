# Undergrad-Research-Code
This repository is for code developed during my undergraduate research opportunity.

As of 4/23/2020, this includes a Data sorter coded using python and the pandas and matplotlib libraries. So far, the program can read in user-input titles of csv and excel files, read these into a dataframe, and sort them based on cell value depending on the desired combination decided by the user. 

4/29/2020 Added a discord webhook to this repo.
